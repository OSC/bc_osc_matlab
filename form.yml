      - **any** - (*28 cores*) Use any available Owens node. This reduces the
        wait time as there are no node requirements.
      - **hugemem** - (*48 cores*) Use an Owens node that has 1.5TB of
        available RAM as well as 48 cores. There are 16 of these nodes on
        Owens.
      - **vis** - (*28 cores*) Use an Owens node that has an [NVIDIA Tesla P100
        GPU](http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-p100.html) with an X server
        running in the background. This utilizes the GPU for hardware
        accelerated 3D visualization. There are 160 of these nodes on Owens.
